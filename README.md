Project Proposal: Tour Booking API

The project aims to develop a Tour Booking API that allows users to browse, book, and manage tours. The API will provide functionality for tour operators to create and manage tour listings, while users can search for tours, make bookings, and leave reviews.

Problem Statement:
Currently, there is a lack of a centralized platform for users to easily find and book tours, and for tour operators to efficiently manage their tour listings. The Tour Booking API seeks to address this problem by providing a seamless and user-friendly interface for both tour operators and users.

Technical Components:

1.Routes:
/api/tours: CRUD operations for tour listings
/api/users: User registration, authentication, and profile management
/api/bookings: Booking management for users and tour operators
/api/reviews: User reviews for tours

2.Data Models:
Tour: Represents a tour listing with details such as name, duration, price, description, images, and available dates

    User: Represents a user with information like name, email, password, and role (user or tour operator)

    Booking: Represents a booking made by a user for a specific tour, including booking date and status

    Review: Represents a user review for a tour, including rating and comment

    External Data Sources:
    None identified at the moment, but potential integration with third-party APIs for payment processing or location-based services

3.Project Requirements:

    User Authentication:
    Implement user registration and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)Secure user passwords using bcrypt for hashing

    Tour Management:
    Allow tour operators to create, update, and delete tour listings
    Implement tour search functionality based on criteria such as location, date, and price range

    Booking Management:
    Enable users to make bookings for specific tours and dates
    Allow tour operators to view and manage bookings for their tours

    User Reviews:
    Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for tours they have booked
    Display average ratings and user reviews for each tour listing

    Error Handling and Validation:
    Implement proper error handling and validation for user inputs and API requests
    Provide meaningful error messages and status codes
